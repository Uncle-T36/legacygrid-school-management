# For SaaS with multiple admins:
ALLOW_ONLY_OWNER_BILLING=False
```

#### 2. Create New Owner User
```bash
# Create new superuser with desired username
python manage.py createsuperuser --username new-owner-username

# Or update existing user in Django admin
# Set is_staff=True and is_superuser=True for admin access
```

- Transfer Stripe account or create new one
- Update PayPal business account details
- Configure mobile money merchant accounts
- Update OpenAI API account

#### 4. Update Branding and Contact Information

#### 5. For SaaS Multi-Tenancy
To convert to SaaS with multiple paying customers:
```bash
# Disable owner-only restrictions
ALLOW_ONLY_OWNER_BILLING=False
PREMIUM_FEATURES_REQUIRE_PAYMENT=True
AI_FEATURES_REQUIRE_PAYMENT=True
```

6. **Regular backups** of billing and user data
7. **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

### Monitoring & Alerts

## üß™ Testing

### Demo Mode
- Set `DEMO_MODE=True` in .env for safe testing
- No real payments processed in demo mode
- All payment gateways use test/sandbox keys
